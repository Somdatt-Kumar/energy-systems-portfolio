# Exergy-Based System Optimization

## Problem
Identify inefficiencies in thermal energy systems using exergy analysis.

## Why it Matters
Exergy analysis reveals true performance losses ignored by energy efficiency alone.

## Methodology
- First and second law analysis
- Component-wise exergy destruction
- Optimization under economic constraints

## Expected Outcomes
- Efficiency improvement strategies
- Cost-performance trade-off insights
