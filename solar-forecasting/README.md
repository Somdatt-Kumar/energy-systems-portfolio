# Solar Power Forecasting

## Problem
Forecast short-term solar power generation for grid stability.

## Why it Matters
Forecasting reduces uncertainty and improves renewable integration.

## Methodology
- Time-series analysis (ARIMA)
- Feature engineering
- Forecast error evaluation

## Data
Historical solar generation datasets.

## Expected Outcomes
- Accurate short-term forecasts
- Comparison of statistical models
